Things to note:

roslaunch motoman_sia20d_moveit_updated trajectory_viewer.launch  //this runs the code

python trajViewer.py //reads the code to display as a contour graph
OR
rosrun motoman_sia20d_moveit_updated trajViewer.py



THINGS TO DO:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add pose information to message to trajectoryViewerPlot
- Check for collisions when doing inverse kinematics
- Save trajectory to a file
- View trajectory visualization in MoveIt!
- Turn the Python code neater
- Organize the file structure (i.e. move all the .dae and .obj files and fix camera_navigation and trajectory_viewer_main to edit image locations)
- Ensure that the examples are interesting (double check launch file for proper start, end, and collision environment)
- Comment code more thoroughly
